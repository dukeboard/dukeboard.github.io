			<h4>What is Kevoree?</h4>
			<p>Kevoree project aims at enabling distributed reconfigurable software development. Build around a component model, Kevoree leverages model@runtime approach to offer tools to build, adapt and synchronize distributed systems.</p>

        </div>
		<div class="span6">
			<h4>Why Kevoree?</h4>
			<p>Extensible, this project already offers runtime for JVM, Android, Arduino but also for virtualization management such as VirtualBox. In short Kevoree helping you to develop your adaptable software from Cloud stack to embedded devices !</p>

        <h4><span class="icon-leaf"></span> Make it easy</h4>
        <p>Kevoree offers an abstraction model that makes easier the manipulation of concepts such as Nodes, Components,
            Synchronization groups and Communication channels in distributed software systems.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h4><span class="icon-sitemap"></span> Distributed modeling</h4>
        <p>Modeling explicits the nodes and the topology of distributed systems. As a system representation, Kevoree
            allows the model itself to be distributed
            across the nodes to share the cluster oraganization.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
        <h4><span class="icon-crop"></span> Event driven, scalable</h4>
        <p>Build around asynchronous model, Kevoree allows design of asynchronous communication, asynchronous
            synchronization.</p>

        <h4><span class="icon-retweet"></span> Continuously design</h4>
        <p>Because long living system must evolve while serving, our approach takes care about HotSwap
            functionality.</p>

        <h4><span class="icon-cloud"></span> Build your own cloud</h4>
        <p>Particular software always need particular optimization. Embeddeding your own adaptation layer in Kevoree
            cluster allows you to build your own cloud.</p>
